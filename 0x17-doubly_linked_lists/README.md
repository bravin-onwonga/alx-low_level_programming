## Task on doubly linked lists

### What are doubly linked lists?
- Almost similar to singly linked list excepts that you can traverse it ```forward``` and ```backward```
- This is possible since doubly linked list contain pointer to the ```previous node``` and the ```next node```, unlike ```singly linked list``` which only contain a pointer to the next node in each node.

### Where are doubly linked list used


### Files in this project:
