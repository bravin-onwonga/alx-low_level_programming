## Task on doubly linked lists

### What are doubly linked lists
- Almost similar to singly linked list excepts that you can traverse the ```forward``` and ```backward```
- This is possible since doubly linked list contain pointer to the ```previous node``` and the ```next node```, unlike ```singly linked list``` which only contain a pointer to the next node in each node.

### Where are doubly linked list used


### Files in this project:

Filename | Description
-------- | -----------
(lists.h)[] | Header file contain all our prototypes
(0-print_dlistint.c)[] | Prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
